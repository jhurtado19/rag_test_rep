Algorithms are step-by-step procedures designed to solve specific problems efficiently. In computer science, algorithms are analyzed for correctness, time complexity, and space complexity. Common categories include sorting algorithms like QuickSort and MergeSort, and graph algorithms such as Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. Algorithm design techniques include divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy methods. Choosing the right algorithm can drastically improve program performance and resource usage. As data sizes grow, algorithmic efficiency becomes even more critical, making optimization and complexity analysis essential skills for software engineers and computer scientists working in performance-sensitive domains.
