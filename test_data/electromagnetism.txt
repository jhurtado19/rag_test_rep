Electromagnetism is a fundamental force describing the interaction between electrically charged particles. It unifies electricity and magnetism into a single theoretical framework, largely developed by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century. Maxwell’s equations explain how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by charges and currents. Electromagnetic waves, such as light, radio waves, and X-rays, are disturbances in these fields that travel through space. Electromagnetism underlies modern technologies including motors, generators, communication systems, and electronic devices. Understanding this force is crucial for physics, engineering, and applied sciences that rely on electromagnetic phenomena.
