The Industrial Revolution was a period of major technological and economic change that began in the late 18th century. Originating in Britain, it introduced innovations such as the steam engine, mechanized textile production, and improved iron-making processes. These advancements transformed agricultural societies into industrialized ones, leading to urbanization and new labor systems. While the revolution boosted productivity and economic growth, it also resulted in harsh working conditions, environmental pollution, and social inequality. Over time, reforms and technological improvements addressed many issues. The Industrial Revolution ultimately shaped modern manufacturing, transportation, and global economic structures.
