Photosynthesis is the biological process through which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. Using chlorophyll, these organisms absorb sunlight and use it to transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts, specifically in the thylakoid membranes and the stroma. Light-dependent reactions generate ATP and NADPH, while the Calvin cycle synthesizes glucose. Photosynthesis is vital for life on Earth, providing oxygen for respiration and forming the base of most food chains. Its efficiency is influenced by light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide levels.
